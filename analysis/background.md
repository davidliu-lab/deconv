# Background

Understanding and predicting the efficacy of immunotherapies in treating metastatic melanoma is an active, unresolved area of investigation. Several investigations have identified genomic and transcriptomic correlates of response at a bulk sample level, including suggestions of biological mechanisms driving response. Furthermore, investigations of single cell transcriptomics have revealed cell type-level features characterizing the development of metastatic melanoma. 

Transcroptomic studies of metasrtatic melanoma and treatment with immunotherapies have identified

Cell-type specific causes and correlates of response to immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma are not well understood. Analyses of bulk transcriptomes of clinical samples have revealed diffentially expressed genes and gene sets associated with clinical outcomes, but the compositional reasons for these differences are not known. That is, it is not known to what extent these sample-level differences are due to (1) differences in cell type proportions in samples and/or (2) differences in gene expression in one or more cell types existing in the samples.

Furthermore, single cell transcriptomes of clinicial samples exist, and have elucidated intra and intertumoral heterogeneity of metastatic melanoma, but such data are not numerous and are mostly not of patients who received immunotherapy. So, while differential expression analyses of bulk transcriptomes of patients with metastatic melanoma have improved our understanding of the causes and correlates of immunotherapies, not much is known with much certainty about the cell type-level phenomena - compositionality and type-specific express - driving these sample-level differences.
