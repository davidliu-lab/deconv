# Overview

In this section I evaluate the

1. Gene expression inference
    1. Does CIBERSORTx falsely infer differentially expressed genes between two identically-produced synthetic cohorts?
    2. If gene expression is perturbed in a certain cell type, with all else equal, does CIBERSORTx correctly infer the perturbed gene expression? Compared to a control, does it identify the perturbed genes as differentially expressed overall and in the perturbed cell type?
