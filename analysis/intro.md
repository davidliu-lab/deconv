# Overview

In this work I investigate the use of deconvolution methods such as CIBERSORTx in inferring cell type composition and type-specific gene expression in bulk RNA-seq of clinical metastatic melanoma samples. With this, we might hope to improve our understanding of the cell type-level processes responsible for, or at least predictive of, the success or failure of immunotherapy in treating this disease.
